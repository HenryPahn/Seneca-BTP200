*************************************************

For Lab, I had never used the matrix before, and I was confused by the commands; however, I figured out 
almost the problem by myself. The instruction for the Lab is not really difficult to understand, but I got 
one problem. The body code in cpp files must be in namespace sdds, I read the requirement in the instruction 
many times, but I did not get it. Finally, I had an appointment, and he helped me figure it out. 
 
For DIY, this is the first time that I approached a project which does not contain many directions in the 
instruction. Initially, I was confused about what I had to do with all the requirements of the projects 
because the correct_output.txt file was the only one that I could hinge on to finish the project. Then 
I read the DIY instruction many times until I realized that I can modify, create functions or do whatever 
I want. 

I made a brief note for my workshop about the functions and added them in each file as comments
to make sure that I would not miss any functions. However, my plan was still not perfect, because the 
parameter of the function did not contain suitable variables, so I spent a long time fixing such 
function parameters. After that, I still added some additional functions, but When I made a brief note for 
each file, my work flowed quickly, Therefore, algorithms are the things left that I have to solve. 

Firstly, it was the way C++ retrieves data from files is so different and more complicated from C. I spent
many hours on GitHub to check my previous projects, but the previous methods did not make sense in this 
workshop, because they pulled data into string variables, If I use that way, I have to use 2 more functions 
in string library to convert it to char array. I finally find the "get" function on Geek For Geeks, and 
It works, but the other problem is that except for the first name, the others always contain the space at the 
first. I tried to find another function to eliminate that space but it doesn't work, so I added space to 
the first of the first name. When I printed out the name, the names were only printed from the second character.

Secondly, sorting was the last function that the project would be finished. I used quick sort, and it worked 
for sorting GPA, but the names were not sorted, so I spent 2 days finding out the solution, then I realized 
the normal sort method, bubble sort, works perfectly. It was a great experience for me and I will start 
everything with the most basic solution first.                                                                                                                               

Finally, when I submitted the workshop to the matrix, it doesn't work. I was so confused because the output of 
my workshop was produced the same as the one professor provides. Then I found that I couldn't make any changes
on the main cpp file. I added a function from UI to operate and link all the files. I moved that function 
into GPAlist.cpp, then it worked. I finished the workshop.
